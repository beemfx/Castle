WinCastle: A Text Based Adventure v5.xx for Windows
===================================================
Castle BUILD 5
Copyright (c) 1997-2006 Blaine Myers

WinCastle will read a Text Based Adventure file(usually with extension .tba) and run it.

Instructions:  To play press the number of your choice when prompted.  Use the game|restart menu command to restart your current game.  To play a custom map use game|custom... and select a valid .tba file.

Programming .tba files:
There is currently no documentation available for .tba construction.  I might write one someday.

Known Issues:

None.

Future of Castle:
Due to the lack of popularity for WinCastle it was decided that plugins would no longer
be supported, an online version of the program is planned, but after that is developed
the project will be considered completed.

Castle BUILD:

The Castle BUILD is the engine used to run castle games, here is some information about all the BUILD's

BUILD 1: The original QuickBasic build of Castle, a fairly crude, very outdated text adventure.  Had extensive use of the obsolete GOTO statement.  BUILD 1 is any 1.xx version of Castle.

BUILD 2: The second build of castle.  Written in the C language it had a much better interface.  The user was no longer required to type in commands.  Only hit a single keystroke.  Story was somewhat rewritten, lots of spelling mistakes corrected.  Build 2 is any 2.xx version of castle.

BUILD 3: Castle finally got a script to run, allowing custom text adventures.  The script was simple and worked very effectively with four different functions.  Build 3 is versions 3.xx.

BUILD 4: The Main program was renamed WinCastle instead of just Castle.  Now Castle is in a Win32 API supporting win 9x and probably ME.  Uses the same script as BUILD 3 and most parts of the game functions are the same.  Advantages are that it uses menus to control the special features in the game.  BUILD 4 is version 4.xx of Castle.

BUILD 5: This newest build looks exactly the same as build 4, but the CastleSCRIPT has been drastically updated to support better features.  BUILD 5 is any version 5.xx of Castle.
