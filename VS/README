# Visual Studio 2022 Project
You can view the source code in this VS Solution, but it won't compile since it
has a lot of legacy calls, you'd have to modify the code to get it to compile.

* getch needs to be changed to _getch.
* clrscr needs to be replaced with something for Windows.
* Other warnings should be addressed as well.
