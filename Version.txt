===        WinCastle: A Text Based Adventure          ===
=========================================================
version 6.XX (October 1, 2015)
	There have been many major changes to how scripts are
	processed, but the script themselves have also changed
	namely the CHOICE statement now uses the format
	CHOICE( "Choice Text 1" , GOTOLABEL1 , "Choice Text 2" , GOTOLABLE2 );
	That way the wrapper for the game can handle choices
	however it wants, whether it be by keyboard, or by
	UI buttons.
	
version 5.50 (December 09, 2006)
	A lot of internal stuff was redone.  Plugin 
	support was removed.  The edit menu was removed.
	Better handling of invalid maps, blank screen
	instead of a crash in most cases.  Most of what
	has been done was to make it easy to create
	an online version of the game.

version 5.21B (November 28, 2003)
	Now using improved data streaming library.

version 5.20B (June 28, 2003)
	WinCastle now uses data streaming, rather than
	file streaming.  So the adventures will now run
	significantly faster.

version 5.11B (June 27, 2003)
	Removed Help File as it was redicuously stupid.
	Also program has compilation optimizations.

version 5.10b (January 24, 2003)
	Goto Statement now works more like c language
	Plugin support is also available, but I am still
	attempting to improve on it.

version 5.01b (January 17, 2003)
	Finally fixed the problem where the icon on the
	about dialog wouldn't show up on Windows NT.  So
	it shows up now.

version 5.00b (June 20, 2002)
	I completely redid CastleSCRIPT to look more like
	c++.  It also compiles more like c++;  The game
	itself looks exactly the same.  This is actually
	a beta release, but for now it is the official
	release.

version 4.07 (June 02, 2002)
	Now fully supports WindowsXP.

version 4.06 (March 24, 2002)
	Improved WinXP support.

version 4.05 (March 11, 2002)
	General C++ optimizations, none of which are
	noticable to the user.

version 4.04 (November 29, 2001)
	Added accelerators to speed things up.  Such as
	restart game which is F3.

version 4.03 (November 27, 2001)
	Dialogs now appear as they should, as I am now
	compiling under microsoft visual c++ instead of
	borland.  The error on terminatoin bug when
	using a custom game is now gone.

version 4.02 (November 01, 2001)
	Improved Dialog by adding an icon.  The text
	displaying the version is now altered by the
	program for easier update.  To change the
	version change the definition of CURVERSION.
	
	Map statistics are no longer displayed at the
	bottom of the screen.  You may go under the
	map|properties to view the stats.

	You may also play a custom map by using the file
	name as a perameter (drag the file into the exe)

version 4.01 (October 30, 2001)
	Minor changes to the code, now menus have
	underlined values.  Window is no longer resizable.
	Added About Dialog Box as well.

version 4.00 (October 6, 2001)
	Caslte updated to WinCastle uses a Win32 API much
	improved over previous versions.  Uses menus for
	special commands.

version 3.02 (September 20, 2001)
	This change only applies to the source code.  The
	game is still played exactly the same.  I added
	a class called CastleGame which contains all the
	functions of a game of castle.  Declaring a game
	and then running the playGame function will the
	filename parameter as the map you wish to play
	will take care of everything.

version 3.01 (May 24, 2001)
	Added support for user maps.  Either drag them
	over the .exe file, use the map name as an argument,
	or us windows Open With command.

version 3.00 (December 31, 2000)
	Complete redo of the game.  The main .exe now reads
	a .tba file and plays the adventure from that. The
	story is the same but I fixed some grammar and
	spelling errors.  I will admit spelling errors
	probably still exist. I also dropped Roleplaying
	out of the title because it really isn't a
	roleplaying game.

version 2.08 (December 10, 2000)
	Redid the enter your name feature now it will print
	out your last name.  Minor code repair.

version 2.07 (August 4, 2000)
	You are now prompted to type your name, and it 
	will appear 2x in the game.  When you begin, and
	when you die.

version 2.06 (July 23, 2000)
	Eliminated the use of the goto statement, by having
	the program call different functions.

version 2.05 (July 10, 2000)
	Used the getch() function rather than the getchar()
	and getc() functions to take input. So now you
	only have to press the number of your choice and
	not press enter.  This eliminates major bugs.

version 2.00 (June 27, 2000)
	Castle was converted to the C language and the 
	name was changed to Castle: A Text Based 
	Roleplaying Adventure.  The game only required you
	to type a number an press enter, rather than 
	typing an entire word out.

version 1.4
	The Third Release of Castle.  Major repairs in 
	the code that allowed you to continue playing 
	even if your character is killed.  Still major 
	problems with the software.

version 1.xx*
	The Second Release of Castle.  Some of the code
	was changed to make it more appealing to the eye.
	A few portions of the game no longer need you to
	type the whole word.

	*Versions were not used by B.M. Software in this
	 release.  But it is between 1.00 and 1.4.

version 1.00
	The Orignal Release of Castle.  Written in the
	QBasic Language.
