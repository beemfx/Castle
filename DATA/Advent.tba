CLS
PR You quickly walk down the right tunnel.

:26
:27
27

CLS
PR You don't want to touch the Axe because you think that
PR it's too dangerous.  Big mistake.  The Axe must have
PR been some kind of trap.  It swings through the air
PR chopping you in half, vertically.  Blood flows onto
PR the floor.
END
26

CLS
PR You grab the Axe then you swing the smooth weapon back
PR and forth through the air.  You are enjoying it very
PR much.  You tie it to your waist with a rope you find,
PR and move on.

CLS
PR You grab onto the rope and begin your descent.  After a

PR so you begin to climb back up.  The rope must not have
PR been as strong as you thought, as it soon snaps and you
PR fall to your death.
END

CLS
PR The ladder shakes violently as you climb up it.
PR Once you reach the top of the shaft you climb onto the
PR edge, only to find the most ugly monster you have ever
PR seen.  You remember the Axe you collected and decide
PR that it's time to make a decision.
CH Will you 1)Attack the monster or 2)Think of something else:
:30
:31

CLS
PR You decide to think of something to do beside slaughter
PR an innocent monster.  Not such a good idea.  While you
PR were concentrating you hardly noticed that your arms
PR and legs were just ripped off.  The monster leaves you
PR limbless.  To Die.
END 
30

CLS
PR You engage in combat with the monster.
PR The battle doesn't last long as you have a weapon and it
PR does not.  You easily hack the beast into a thousand
PR pieces, but it takes you quite a while.
PR
PR After the slaughter you dash down a hallway.  After a
PR few hours of running you approach a floating barricade.
PR There is just enough room to go under or over it.

:32
:33
