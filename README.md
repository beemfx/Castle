# Castle: A Text Based Roleplaying Adventure

This is the C version of Castle.

## Building

Being that this was my first C program it is not ANSI compliant and has limited
compiler support. It was originally compiled using Borland C++ 4.52 and that
can compile it to a working binary (an ide project is provided). The code could
be modified to compile on modern compilers with a few tweaks, but I want to
preserve the original code as is.
