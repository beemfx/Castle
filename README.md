# Castle: A Text Adventure

The game Castle for QBasic, the first game every developed by Beem Software. I
would not recommend this version as it is more for refence than anything. For
some reason I wrote the story with caps lock on, and there are lots of spelling
and grammar errors. All of this has been corrected in the modern versions.

## Building
CASTLEXXX.BAS can be compiled with QBasic 4.5. It can also be run in a QBasic
interpreter. (A build script is provided, but it may need tweaking depending on
your specific setup.)
