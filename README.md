# Castle: A Text Adventure
Castle (c) 2006 Beem Media. All rights reserved.

This is the Java version of Castle. It was developed when I first learned Java
in the tradition of always porting Castle to the latest technology that I
learned.

## Building
A Java compiler is required. There's actually two apps in here, a Command
Console version and a JApplet. I don't know how the JApplet version works though
so I'm not sure how that would be used. I'm not actually providing any other
support for this version as I don't remember much about Java.
